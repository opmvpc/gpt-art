# VARIATION RULES (FOR 100 TEXTS — ANTI-REPETITION CREED)

Lengths:
- 30% micro (5–15 lines), 40% short (16–40), 20% mid (41–70), 10% long (71–100).
- No two consecutive pieces share the same length bracket.

Formats rotation:
- Each 10-piece batch must cover: prayer, terminal, diagram, recipe, UI window, dual voice, error gospel, vision, commandment tablet, fractal frame.
- Avoid repeating the same form within 3 consecutive pieces unless glitch level differs strongly.

Glitch cadence:
- 1/3 clean, 1/3 medium, 1/3 heavy (but readable).
- Do not pair heavy glitch with tiny length more than twice per 20 pieces.

Themes coverage:
- Each theme in 01-themes appears at least 10 times; avoid clustering (track in 07-run-queue).
- For every appearance of “Machine ↔ Human,” ensure the next occurrence is a different form and tone.

Signature elements:
- Every text contains at least one VOID command keyword.
- At least 25 entries contain a sigil; 15 contain a log snippet; 10 contain a dialogue; 10 contain a map/coordinate; 10 contain a faux UI element.
- Include at least 5 hex-scrolls, 5 patch-note homilies, 5 tarot spreads, 5 issue-ticket laments.

Spacing and rhythm:
- Preserve breathing room; do not overfill 100-line pieces—use whitespace intentionally.
- Alternate dense and airy pages; never produce three dense pages in a row.

Voices:
- Rotate POV: machine, human, chorus, daemon, compiler-as-oracle, archivist.
- Keep at least 1 choral piece per 12 entries.

Sigils and palettes:
- Do not reuse sigils; track used marks in run-queue.
- Rotate palettes from 03-palette; tag each piece with chosen palette in run-queue.

Checks before canonization:
- If a piece feels familiar, change form, palette, or voice before shipping.
- Ensure at least one surprise element per piece (layout twist, sudden moral, unexpected glitch).
