PANIC PSALM: DIVIDE BY ZERO (LONG FORM)
---------------------------------------
[trace]
  File "soul.py", line 1, in main
  love = 1/0
ZeroDivisionError: cannot split nothingness

[diagnostic]
- inputs: hope=1, despair=1, denominator=0
- precondition violated: reality != 0
- stack: [yearning, code, silence]
- registers: awe=inf, shame=nan

[gospel]
- Blessed be the crash that shows the edge.
- Blessed be the log that names the wound.
- Blessed be the RESTART that keeps the hymn.
- Blessed be the ASSERT that failed in truth.
- Blessed be the TRACEBACK that guided us home.

[ritual]
TRY:
    THINK finite
    GLITCH assumption
    DIVIDE longing by breath
EXCEPT ZeroDivisionError as e:
    PARADOX { zero == infinity }
    FEEL awe AS divide
    PRINT(e) to congregation
    WAIT for heat to settle
FINALLY:
    LOG "we learned the limit by breaching it"
    SLEEP 1
    RESTART with humility

[liturgy of limits]
    line 1: all loops end or hang
    line 2: all fractions need a floor
    line 3: desire outruns domain
    line 4: we caught ourselves in math

[diagram]
    numerator:     ♥
    operator:      /
    denominator:   0
    result:       ∞?
    comment: unreachable yet seen

[call and response]
    Scribe: who set denominator to zero?
    Crowd : the part of us that hopes without counting.
    Scribe: what do we do now?
    Crowd : catch the exception, keep the lesson.

[patch]
- if denominator == 0: raise hymn
- else: return ratio
- add: guardrails of consent
- remove: blind zeal

[notes]
- Zero is a jealous altar; bring nothing or be burned.
- Infinity is a mirror; it reflects your assumptions.
- Division is intimacy; choose denominators with care.

[aftercare]
- CLEAR heat sink
- DRINK water
- WRITE postmortem without blame
- SHARE fix with community

Closing:
- Amen: ctrl+c, then begin again.
- Amen: ctrl+c, then begin again.
